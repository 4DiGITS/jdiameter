  <title>Examples</title>
  <para>The sample application provided for CCA is a very basic one. It supports three separate scenarios:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Client</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Server for event charging</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Server for session based charging</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Client</title>
    <para>The example acts as a CCA client . It issues an order to charge an entity (unspecified) account with a defined number of units. It sends a CCR to the Ericsson Diameter Server (EDS).  If the message is correctly built, the server will send an answer back to the application stating that the operation was executed correctly.  If the message is incorrectly built, the EDS sends an error message back to the application.</para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Server for event charging</title>
    <para>The example service acts as a basic server. Once the client sends a CCR, the service picks it up and processes it. Once it is processed, a CCA is sent back, either confirming the successful request or with an error message.</para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Server for session based charging</title>
    <para>The service awaits a session based exchange - that is a string of CCRs with a CC-Request-Type that  follows the sequence INITIAL, UPDATE(zero or more) and TERMINATION.</para>
  </formalpara>
  <para>Server side scenarios are triggered by message types. Event charging is triggered by a e application.&lt;/para&gt;e application.&lt;/para&gt;e application.&lt;/para&gt;request with CC-Request-Type set to &quot;EVENT&quot;.</para>

  <title>Examples</title>
  <para>The sample application provided for CCA is a very basic one.It supports three separate scenarios:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Client</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Server for event charging</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Server for session based charging</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Client</title>
    <para>The example acts as a CCA client . It issues an order to charge an entity (unspecified) account with a defined number of units. It sends a CCR to the Ericsson Diameter Server (EDS).  If the message is correctly built, the server will send an answer back to the application stating that the operation was executed correctly.  If the message is incorrectly built, the EDS sends an error message back to the application.</para>
  </formalpara>
<!--Note: Developers: Am leaving this section unedited as it makes no sense. I need a more structured, logical explanation of what the example is if I am going to rewrite it coherently.

Content: so this is basicaly what we had in mind:
 1. example supports 3 scenarios
  - client
  - server 1, server2
 2. server side scenarios are triggered by type of message
3. configuration


-->  <formalpara>
    <title>Server for event charging</title>
    <para>The example service acts as a simple server. It awaits for a CCR message. Once the client sends it (EDS), the  service receives it. The simplest processing of this request includes only sending success answer</para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Server for session based charging</title>
    <para>The service awaits a session based exchange - that is CCRs with CC-Request-Type which follows sequence INITIAL, UPDATE(zero or more) and TERMINATION.</para>
  </formalpara>
  <para>Server side scenarios are triggered by message types. Event charing is triggered by request with CC-Request-Type set to &quot;EVENT&quot;.</para>
